# Dog-Breed-Classifier

## Installation

All libaries are included in Anaconda distribution. The code works with Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

CNNs are used to classify dog breeds of images of dogs and human faces (the dog breed they may resemble). 

## File Descriptions

The notebook "dog_app.ipynb" is the only file actively used. Supporting files can be searched online. Comments and markdown cells were used to explain the code. 

## How to Interact with the Project

The cells can all be run in a linearly fashion. A GPU was enabled to run the notebook. Any image with its file path can be used to detect dogs or humans and see what dog breed they may resemble.
